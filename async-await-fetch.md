# Async / Await / Fetch

## Fetch
- Newest standard for dealing with HTTP requests
- Part of window object
- Returns promise

## Async
- Apply to function you want to fetch data inside of
- Use await within async function

## Await
- Use to mark location where you want to wait for async fn to return
- Await returns only after the promise resolves
